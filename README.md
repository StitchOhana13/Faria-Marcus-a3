Welcome to Warp Pipe Dream! Heavily inspired by the Mario Party 7 minigame of the same name, your goal is to pass through the Purple warp pipes to reach the center of the maze! Hit the Slay Button (WASD or the arrow keys) to move. Keep track of your score at the end so you can compare (Score tracker does not work D:)! (Tip: if walking into a pipe doesn't teleport you right away, back up and try entering again.)
